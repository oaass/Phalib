Phalib - Add on's for PhalconPHP
===

**Important:** The master is currently unstable. I'm making a development branch now, and will get master back to a
stable state as soon as possible.

Phalib is a project that contains reusable code across project using PhalconPHP. It will have a wide range of plugins
and everything is made as standalone packages, meaning that none of the packages in this library is dependant on
eachother.
